# 🚀 SUMMARY
I'm not your average developer - I've got a background in management, I am a Co-founder & Former CEO, Graphical LTD, I've led teams of 10 to 20 people in marketing, sales, and finance, which means I know how to lead a team and get stuff done. But don't worry, I won't be the office know-it-all. I'm a fun person who knows how to work hard and play hard.

# EXPERIENCE

- Developed and maintained full-stack applications using JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and REST APIs.  I'm like a coding mad scientist, but with better hair.
- Created visually stunning user interfaces with SASS, HTML, and CSS. It's like I'm a web Picasso, but without the weird mustache.
- Implemented Web Sockets for real-time communication between clients and servers. Because let's be real, nobody likes waiting around for a page to load.
- Utilized TypeScript for type checking and enhanced code reliability. 
- I'm like the coding Superman, but instead of saving people, I save code from crashing.

- Managed a team of 10 to 20 people in marketing, sales, and finance to generate revenue of over 2 million USD in 3 years.

### Artillery Corps Soldier, Israel Defense Forces, [2013-2016]
